The Writer agent synthesizes information from the Researcher and feedback from the Critic to create coherent, well-structured responses. We'll implement a Writer agent using LangChain and GPT-4.1, and demonstrate how it enhances the quality of AI-generated content."

    "- The `temperature` parameter is set to 0.6, which is a middle ground between the fact-focused Researcher (0.5) and the more creative Critic (0.7). This balanced setting allows the Writer to be creative in its presentation while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "- The `model_name` parameter specifies which language model to use. We're using GPT-4.1 for its advanced capabilities in understanding complex information and generating well-structured content.\n",

      "### 1. **Privacy and Data Security**\n",
      "- **Patient Confidentiality:** AI systems require large datasets, often containing sensitive personal health information. Ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is crucial.\n",
      "- **Data Breaches:** Increased digitalization raises the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Bias and Fairness**\n",
      "- **Algorithmic Bias:** AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data, leading to unequal treatment or misdiagnosis, especially among minority or underrepresented groups.\n",
      "- **Equitable Access:** Disparities in access to AI-driven healthcare tools may exacerbate existing health inequalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Transparency and Explainability**\n",
      "- **Black Box Problem:** Many AI models, especially deep learning systems, lack transparency, making it difficult for clinicians and patients to understand how decisions are made.\n",
      "- **Informed Consent:** Patients should be informed when AI is involved in their care and understand the implications.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Decision-Making:** AI should support, not replace, human clinical judgment. Overreliance on AI can undermine clinicians’ expertise and patients’ autonomy.\n",
      "- **Patient Choice:** Patients should have the right to accept or refuse AI-involved care.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Clinical Safety and Effectiveness**\n",

    "4. **Audience Adaptation**: Different users may have different levels of expertise or preferences for how information is presented, which can be challenging for a one-size-fits-all Writer.\n",
